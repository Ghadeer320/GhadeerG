First I open Terminal.
Then I use pwd command to writes the full pathname of my current working.”pwd”
Then I go to desktop “cd desktop” 
I see all the fillies in desktop “ls-la”
I create a new Git repository.
After that I download Github file to my desktop “git clone”
Then I create Readme.me file “touch” and I add to Github “git add”
After that I Commit the Readme.me file “git commit -m "First commit””
Then I add the URL for the remote repository where my local repository will be pushed.”git remote “
Finally I push the changes in my local repository to GitHub.”git push”
And I use “git status”  a lot to see my file status
Then I did the same steps to create html file inside my new Git repository GhadeerG
And the last thing I did is open Readme.me file to describe my work “open .” and i will commit to save the change.
